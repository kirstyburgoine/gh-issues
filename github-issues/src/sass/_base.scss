html {
	font-size: calc(12px + (16 - 12) * ((100vw - 300px) / (1680 - 300)));
}

// To break this down in a few lines we have
// 12px as the minimum font size
// 16 as the largest, minus the smallest (12)
// We times that by 100VW minus the smallest screen size in mind for the 12px size, 300px
// Finally divide that by the largest screen width (1680) defined for 16px minus the smallest screen size again.
// So if you wanted the font-size to be 16px on a screen at 320px wide, and 22px on a screen 1600px wide the declaration would be:
//
// html { font-size: calc(16px + (22 - 16) * ((100vw - 320px) / (1600 - 320))); }
//
// 16px is minimum font-size
// 22px is largest - minus smallest ()
// multiply this by 100vw minus the smallest screen size in mind for 16px
// Finally divide that by the largest screen width (1600) defined for 22px minus the smallest screen size again
